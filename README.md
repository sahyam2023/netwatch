## PingWatch: Advanced Network & System Diagnostics Tool

PingWatch is a powerful, multi-featured desktop application built with Python and PyQt5, designed for network administrators, developers, and IT professionals. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for real-time network monitoring, system benchmarking, and in-depth troubleshooting, all within a single, intuitive graphical user interface.

## Features

PingWatch integrates several essential utilities into one application, making it a versatile tool for any diagnostic task.

#### ðŸ“ˆ **Real-Time Ping Monitoring**
- **Monitor Multiple Targets:** Track the status of hundreds of IPs or hostnames simultaneously.
- **Detailed Statistics:** View real-time data on successful pings, timeouts, packet loss, and error types.
- **Dynamic Graphing:** Select any IP to visualize its ping latency (RTT) over time in a real-time graph, helping to spot jitter and performance issues.
- **Configurable Alerts:** Set custom rules to trigger tray notifications and sound alerts (e.g., "alert if an IP has more than 5 timeouts in 60 seconds").
- **Data Exporting:** Save monitoring sessions, including full event logs and timeout summaries, to a `.log` file for later analysis.

#### ðŸ“¡ **Network Scanning**
- **IP Scanner (ARP Scan):** Discover all active devices on your local network. The scanner identifies IP addresses, MAC addresses, hostnames, and device vendors.
- **Port Scanner:** Perform fast and reliable port scans on any target.
  - **Basic Scan:** A quick TCP connect scan for open ports.
  - **Advanced Nmap Scan:** Leverage Nmap (if installed) for advanced capabilities like service/version detection (`-sV`) and OS detection (`-O`).

#### ðŸ”¬ **Network Diagnostics**
- **DNS Diagnostics:** Perform DNS lookups for various record types (`A`, `AAAA`, `MX`, `NS`, `CNAME`, `PTR`, etc.) against your default or a specified DNS server.
- **Live Path Analysis (Traceroute/MTR):** Launch a continuous traceroute to any destination to inspect the entire network path. It provides live, hop-by-hop statistics on latency and packet loss, making it easy to identify bottlenecks.

#### ðŸ“¦ **Packet Capture**
- **Live Capture:** Capture network traffic on any selected network interface.
- **Powerful Filtering:** Apply BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) syntax for kernel-level filtering (e.g., `host 8.8.8.8 and port 443`) and a live display filter to search through captured packets.
- **Detailed Packet Dissection:** Click any packet to see a full breakdown of its layers and fields, as well as its raw byte representation.
- **Save to PCAP:** Save the entire capture session to a `.pcap` file for analysis in other tools like Wireshark.

#### ðŸ’¾ **Disk Benchmark**
- **Comprehensive Performance Testing:** Measure your drive's performance under various conditions.
- **Sequential & Random Tests:** Run tests for sequential read/write (large file transfers) and random read/write (OS/application responsiveness).
- **Key Metrics:** Get detailed results for both Speed (MB/s) and IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second).
- **Configurable Parameters:** Adjust the test file size and random block size (e.g., 4KB, 128KB, 1MB) to simulate different workloads.
- **Export Results:** Save benchmark results to a CSV file for record-keeping or comparison.

#### ðŸ§® **Calculators**
- **Camera Storage Calculator:** Estimate the total storage (in TB) required for a CCTV/NVR setup based on the number of cameras, bandwidth, recording hours, and retention period.
- **RAID Performance Calculator:** Theorize the performance of different RAID levels (0, 1, 5, 6, 10) by inputting drive count, single-drive IOPS, and throughput.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
You need Python 3.x installed on your system. The application relies on several Python packages, which can be installed via `pip`.

#### Dependencies
Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following contents:
```
PyQt5
pyqtgraph
icmplib
requests
numpy
sympy
scapy
python-nmap
mac-vendor-lookup
dnspython
PyQt5-sip
pyqt-tools
```

For `scapy` and `nmap` to function correctly, you may need to install platform-specific dependencies:
- **Windows:** Npcap (for Scapy) and Nmap (for advanced scanning).
- **Linux:** `tcpdump` (usually pre-installed) and Nmap.

### Running from Source
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/PingWatch.git
    cd PingWatch
    ```

2.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    python pinger.py
    ```
> **Note: Requires Admin Privileges**
> For full functionality (especially for ICMP pings, packet capture, and accurate disk benchmarking), the application must be run with administrative privileges.
> - **Windows:** Right-click your terminal (PowerShell/CMD) or IDE and select "Run as Administrator" before executing the script.
> - **Linux/macOS:** Run the script with `sudo`: `sudo python pinger.py`.

### Building the Executable
A PyInstaller `.spec` file can be used to build a standalone executable.

1.  **Install PyInstaller:**
    ```sh
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```

2.  **Place Required Assets:**
    Make sure `app_icon.ico` and `alert.wav` are in the same directory as `pinger.py`. You will need to create a `pinger.spec` file.

3.  **Build the executable:**
    A pre-configured `.spec` file is recommended to bundle the icon/sound files and to request admin privileges on Windows.
    ```sh
    pyinstaller pinger.spec
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    The standalone executable will be located in the `dist/PingWatch` directory.

## Development
The application is architected around the **worker thread pattern** to ensure the GUI remains responsive at all times.

- **`PingMonitorWindow`**: The main application class. It handles all UI setup, signal/slot connections, and initiates all user actions.
- **Worker Classes (`PingWorker`, `DiskBenchmarkWorker`, `IpScanWorker`, etc.)**: Each worker class is a `QObject` that runs on a separate `QThread`. It performs a specific, time-consuming task and communicates back to the main window using Qt's signal and slot mechanism, preventing the GUI from freezing.
- **Custom Models (`PingDataModel`)**: A custom `QAbstractItemModel` is used to efficiently manage, update, and display the large amount of data in the ping monitoring results view, providing fast sorting and updates.
